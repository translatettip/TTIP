Conformity Assessment Procedures

1. The Parties undertake to co-operate with a view to reducing unnecessary burdens arising from differences in their respective conformity assessment requirements.
2. To that end, the Parties undertake to review within [timeline to be discussed] their conformity assessment procedures in order to move progressively towards the least burdensome possible procedures, commensurate with the risk that the underlying technical regulations are intended to address. Priority areas for consideration shall include electrical safety, electro-magnetic compatibility, machinery and telecommunications.
3. [Placeholder for referencing specific outcomes on conformity assessment resulting from the negotiations in individual sectors]
4. Where Parties require third party conformity assessment of products as a condition of compliance with technical regulations applicable on their respective territories, the Parties undertake to give consideration to mechanisms to facilitate the mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment conducted by conformity assessment bodies (CABs) located on the territory of the exporting Party.
5.
  (a) The Parties shall take measures sufficient to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest between conformity assessment bodies and standardization bodies, notably by establishing a clear separation of functions between them in cases where a standard referenced in technical regulations or otherwise allowed to be used to achieve compliance with technical regulations is set by an entity that also operates in the conformity assessment market.
  (b) The Parties shall ensure that standards referenced in technical regulations do not contain technical requirements that limit the choice of CABs or that refer to specifics CABs.
6. The Parties agree that, where a class of products is subject to conformity assessment procedures, and where components or parts of such products are also subject to conformity assessment procedures (and thus constitute products in their own right), CABs approved by the regulator to assess products that include such components or parts shall be obliged by the regulator not to require as a condition of assessing the product as a whole, that such components or parts be re-assessed by th CABs themselves, independently of the final product.
7. The Parties shall take appropriate steps to prevent the establishment or abuse of dominant positions by any CAB in the market of its territory for the assessment of a specific product or class of risks.
8.

1. Each Party shall accredit, approve, license, or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies in the territory of the other Party on terms no less favorable than those it accords to conformity assessment bodies in its territory.
2. In order to ensure that it accords no less favorable treatment pursuant to paragraph 1, each Party shall treat conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other Party as follows:
  (a) No Party shall require a conformity assessment body to be located within its territory as a condition to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize the conformity assessment body or impose requirements on the conformity assessment body that would effectively require it to operate an office in the Party's territory.
  (b) Each Party shall apply no less favorable procedures, criteria or other conditions to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies located in the other Party's territory as it applies to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies located in its territory, including by permitting conformity assessment bodies located in the other Party's territory to apply to be accredited, approved, licensed or otherwise recognized by a body located in the Party's territory.
  (c) Each Party shall permit any conformity assessment body located in the territory of the other Party to apply to the Party, or any body that it has recognized or approved for this purpose, to be accredited, approved, licensed or otherwise recognized under any procedures, criteria and other conditions the Party applies to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognize conformity assessment bodies.
3. For greater certainty, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude a Party from limiting recognition of conformity assessment bodies in relation to specific products to specified government bodies of the Party located within the Party's territory or the territory of the other Party.

In relation to any technical regulation or standard for which a Party requires third-party conformity assessment, each Party shall make publicly available a list of the bodies that it has accredited, approved, licensed or otherwise recognized to perform such conformity assessment and relevant information on the scope of each such body's accreditation, approval, license or recognition.
7. Where a Party undertakes conformity assessment in relation to specific products within specified government bodies located in its own territory or the other Party's territory, the Party shall, upon the request of the other Party or the applicant, explain:
  (a) the order in which conformity assessment procedures are undertaken and completed;
  (b) how fees for its conformity assessment procedures are calculated;

For greater certainty, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a Party from requiring subcontractors to meet the same requirements that the conformity assessment body to which it is contracted would be required to meet in order to perform the contracted tests or inspection itself.
9. With respect to an accreditation body located in the territory of the other Party, no Party shall refuse to accept, or take actions which have the effect of, directly or indirectly, requiring or encouraging the refusal of acceptance of conformity assessment results performed by a conformity assessment body in the other Party's territory because the accreditation body that accredited the conformity assessment body:

If a Party intends to select an existing or planned voluntary standard for reference in technical regulations, such selection shall be subject to objective, clear and transparent criteria, which shall be published before the selection is made. Standards for reference in technical regulations applicable on all or part of the territory of the Parties shall be selected following consideration of relevant international standards and other standards developed through an open and transparent process, including standards developed by standardization bodies located within the territory of the other Party.
4. The Parties undertake to keep references to standards in support of technical regulations up to date with the latest version of the standard and the latest review of the technical regulation.
5. The Parties shall endeavor to ensure that, in using standards to achieve compliance with the requirements of technical regulations or parts thereof, suppliers are free to use standards other than those chosen by domestic regulators for reference in such technical regulations, without prior authorization from the regulator, provided that such suppliers can demonstrate (e.g., through adequate technical documentation) that the applied alternative solution complies with the requirements of the technical regulation, or parts thereof.]

[US: Article 6: Standards

1. Each Party shall apply the Decision of the TBT Committee on Principles for the Development of the International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement (the „Committee Decision“), issued by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (G/TBT/1Rev.10) in determining whether an international standard, guide, or recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement or Article 4 of this Chapter exists.

Accordingly, no Party shall refuse to treat a standard as an international standard based on:
  (a) the domicile of the body that developed the standard;
  (b) whether the body that developed the standard is an intergovernmental body; or
  (c) whether the body that developed the standard provides for participation in its standards activities through national delegations or limits participation in its standards activities to persons affiliated with a government.
3. Where a Party requests or directs a body or bodies to prepare a standard with a view to mandating that a product comply with that standard, establishing a generally applicable presumption that a product complies with a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure if it conforms to that standard, or otherwise allowing the standard to be used as a basis for or in support of compliance with technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure it shall observe, mutatis mutandis, the obligations set out in Articles 2.9.1. through 2.9.4 and 5.6.1 through 5.6.4 of the TBT Agreement and Article 4 of this Chapter.

7. If a Party systematically gives preference, for purposes of complying with technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, to standards that are developed through processes that do not allow persons of the other Party to participate on terms no less favorable than persons of the Party or that do not consider using as a basis for the standard any relevant standard developed in accordance with the Committee, the Party shall:
  (a) maintain a process for persons of the other Party to submit an assessment to the Party that a standard other than the standard given preference for purposes of complying with the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure fulfills the relevant requirements of that technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure; and
  (b) no later than {30} days from the date it receives an assessment under subparagraph (a):
    (i) decide whether to accept the assessment based on whether the standard fulfills the relevant requirements of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure and notify the person of its decision and the reasons therefor; and
    (ii) publish its decision, including its reasons therefor, and transmit instructions to its customs and market surveillance authorities that any product from any supplier that conforms to the standard, or for which a conformity assessment procedure was performed in accordance with the standard, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the relevant requirements of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure.
8. For purposes of paragraph {7}, a Party:
  (a) may require that an assessment contain supporting documentation adequate to make the decision provided for in subparagraph 7(b)(i);

Marking and Labeling

1. In accordance with Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, with respect to technical regulations relating to labeling or marking requirements, the Parties shall ensure they are not prepared, adopted or applied with a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade. For this purpose, such labeling or marking requirements shall not be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective, taking account of the risks that non-fulfillment would create. Compulsory marking requirements, while continuing to provide the necessary information to the user or consumer as well as to public authorities regarding compliance or products with specific requirements, should be limited as far as possible to what is essential and to what is the least trade restrictive to achieve the legitimate objective pursued.
2. The Parties undertake to engage in a review of their marking and labeling requirements with a view to identifying sectors and areas where divergences could be reduced.
